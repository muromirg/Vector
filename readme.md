Made out of educational purposes

Here is my variation of std::vector. Vector interface is pretty similar to std::vector one. Also RAII and C++ move semantics are supported.

To use you need to locate source files to some folder and include "myvector.hpp" to your project.

You may run "make test" to build test program, which run tests located in "vector_test.h"
